|Correct matching between the chosen scenario and functions|Excellent: All chosen methods match the planned scenario|5/5|
|Completeness and correctness of the test case|Excellent: All the timing and memory spatial constraints of the assignment (task starting times, sizes, and intervals) were fully followed|5/5|

Total Points: 36/40

## Grader Notes:
* You’ve mostly done a solid job devising a relevant solution.
* Your analysis is not sufficiently developed and should be further explored.
* Several different scenarios have been tested.
* All of the relevant functions have been utilized.
* You’ve done a good job taking in mind the spatial constraints.
